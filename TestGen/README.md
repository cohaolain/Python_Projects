# TestGen
Written by Ciarán Ó hAoláin, 2018.  
This is a Python library I originally used to populate a Firebase 
Firestore database with test data. I plan on expanding it to generate an 
assortment of test data for use in many different testing applications. 
I also plan on packaging it properly as a library, and adding it to 
PyPi.
